      `Dear Ms. Steelman and Ulta Beauty Leadership,

I am writing to urge Ulta Beauty to immediately remove Huda Beauty products from your stores and website.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan shared a video with her 5 million Instagram followers discussing Iran. In it, she admitted she “doesn’t really know what’s going on,” claimed to have heard “mixed things,” and then proceeded to repeat Islamic Republic propaganda, dismissing mass killings as an “internal issue.”

Since December 28th, over 36,000 Iranians have been killed during peaceful protests, and more than 24,000 detained protesters now face possible execution. Iranian American families are living in fear, unable to reach loved ones amid this violence.

Ulta Beauty should not continue profiting from a brand whose founder spreads disinformation that minimizes ongoing atrocities. I urge you to take immediate action and remove Huda Beauty products.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Ms. Steelman,

I am contacting you with deep concern about Ulta Beauty’s continued partnership with Huda Beauty.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan publicly addressed Iran while admitting she did not understand the situation, yet she amplified regime narratives and dismissed widespread killings as an “internal issue.” This messaging provides cover for ongoing violence.

Since late December, more than 36,000 people have been killed during peaceful protests, and over 24,000 arrested protesters face possible execution. These are not abstract numbers — Iranian American families are desperately trying to reach loved ones they fear may already be dead.

Ulta Beauty has a responsibility to act ethically. I urge you to immediately remove Huda Beauty products from your shelves.

Thank you for your consideration,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Ms. Steelman and Ulta Beauty Leadership,

I am writing to request that Ulta Beauty remove Huda Beauty products in response to recent public statements by the brand’s founder.

In a January 28, 2026 video shared with millions, Huda Kattan stated she “doesn’t really know” what is happening in Iran, yet proceeded to repeat Islamic Republic propaganda and frame mass killings as an internal issue.

Since December 28th, more than 36,000 Iranians have been killed during peaceful protests, and tens of thousands more have been arrested and now face execution. Iranian American families are living with unbearable uncertainty.

Continuing to sell Huda Beauty products aligns Ulta with messaging that minimizes genocide. I urge immediate removal of the brand.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]`,
      `Hello Ulta Beauty Leadership,

I am urging Ulta Beauty to take action regarding Huda Beauty following its founder’s recent statements about Iran.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan shared a video admitting she did not understand the situation in Iran, yet she dismissed mass killings as an “internal issue” while repeating regime talking points to millions of followers.

Since December 28th, over 36,000 protesters have been killed and more than 24,000 detained protesters now face possible execution. Iranian American families are watching this unfold while being unable to contact loved ones.

Ulta Beauty should not profit from a brand whose leadership spreads disinformation during a humanitarian catastrophe. I urge you to remove Huda Beauty products immediately.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Ms. Steelman and Ulta Beauty Leadership,

I am writing to express serious concern about Ulta Beauty continuing to sell Huda Beauty products.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan addressed Iran in a video shared with millions, openly stating she did not fully understand the situation while simultaneously amplifying Islamic Republic narratives and dismissing mass killings as an “internal issue.”

Since December 28th, more than 36,000 Iranians have been killed during peaceful protests, and over 24,000 arrested protesters now face execution. These events are devastating for Iranian American families following the crisis from afar.

Ulta Beauty has an opportunity to take a clear ethical stance by removing Huda Beauty products from its stores and website immediately.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]  `
