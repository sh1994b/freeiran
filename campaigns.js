      `Dear Ms. Patrick, Ms. Willat, and Sephora Leadership,

I am writing to urge Sephora Beauty to immediately remove Huda Beauty products from your stores and website.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan shared a video with her 5 million Instagram followers discussing Iran. In it, she admitted she “doesn’t really know what’s going on,” claimed to have heard “mixed things,” and then proceeded to repeat Islamic Republic propaganda, dismissing mass killings as an “internal issue.”

Since December 28th, over 36,000 Iranians have been killed during peaceful protests, and more than 24,000 detained protesters now face possible execution. Iranian American families are living in fear, unable to reach loved ones amid this violence.

Sephora should not continue profiting from a brand whose founder spreads disinformation that minimizes ongoing atrocities. I urge you to take immediate action and remove Huda Beauty products.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Ms. Patrick, Ms. Willat, and Sephora Leadership,

I am contacting you with deep concern about Sephora Beauty’s continued partnership with Huda Beauty.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan publicly addressed Iran while admitting she did not understand the situation, yet she amplified regime narratives and dismissed widespread killings as an “internal issue.” This messaging provides cover for ongoing violence.

Since late December, more than 36,000 people have been killed during peaceful protests, and over 24,000 arrested protesters face possible execution. These are not abstract numbers — Iranian American families are desperately trying to reach loved ones they fear may already be dead.

Sephora has a responsibility to act ethically. I urge you to immediately remove Huda Beauty products from your shelves.

Thank you for your consideration,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Sephora Leadership,

I am writing to request that Sephora Beauty remove Huda Beauty products in response to recent public statements by the brand’s founder.

In a January 28, 2026 video shared with millions, Huda Kattan stated she “doesn’t really know” what is happening in Iran, yet proceeded to repeat Islamic Republic propaganda and frame mass killings as an internal issue.

Since December 28th, more than 36,000 Iranians have been killed during peaceful protests, and tens of thousands more have been arrested and now face execution. Iranian American families are living with unbearable uncertainty.

Continuing to sell Huda Beauty products aligns Sephora with messaging that minimizes genocide. I urge immediate removal of the brand.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]`,
      `Hello Sephora Leadership,

I am urging Sephora Beauty to take action regarding Huda Beauty following its founder’s recent statements about Iran.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan shared a video admitting she did not understand the situation in Iran, yet she dismissed mass killings as an “internal issue” while repeating regime talking points to millions of followers.

Since December 28th, over 36,000 protesters have been killed and more than 24,000 detained protesters now face possible execution. Iranian American families are watching this unfold while being unable to contact loved ones.

Sephora should not profit from a brand whose leadership spreads disinformation during a humanitarian catastrophe. I urge you to remove Huda Beauty products immediately.

Respectfully,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Ms. Patrick, Ms. Willat, and Sephora Leadership,

I am writing to express serious concern about Sephora Beauty continuing to sell Huda Beauty products.

On January 28, 2026, Huda Kattan addressed Iran in a video shared with millions, openly stating she did not fully understand the situation while simultaneously amplifying Islamic Republic narratives and dismissing mass killings as an “internal issue.”

Since December 28th, more than 36,000 Iranians have been killed during peaceful protests, and over 24,000 arrested protesters now face execution. These events are devastating for Iranian American families following the crisis from afar.

Sephora has an opportunity to take a clear ethical stance by removing Huda Beauty products from its stores and website immediately.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]  `,
      `Dear Sephora,
I'm writing to request immediate removal of Huda Beauty products.
On January 28, Huda Kattan admitted she doesn't know what's happening in Iran, then spread regime propaganda to 5 million followers, dismissing the massacre of 36,000+ Iranians as an "internal issue."
Over 36,000 people have been killed since December 28th, with 24,000 more facing execution. Iran has imposed a total communications blackout. Iranian Americans cannot reach their families and live in terror. This is genocide, not an internal issue.
Huda is whitewashing mass murder. Sephora cannot profit from a brand spreading disinformation that covers for atrocities.

Please remove all Huda Beauty products immediately.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Sephora Leadership,
      
Huda Kattan used her platform to spread Islamic Republic propaganda about Iran's ongoing massacre, admitting she "doesn't really know what's going on" before sharing regime talking points to millions.
The facts: 36,000+ Iranians killed since December 28th. Iranian American families unreachable for two weeks due to communications blackout. 24,000 protesters awaiting execution. Huda dismissed this as just an "internal issue."
By selling Huda Beauty, Sephora profits from someone actively spreading misinformation during a genocide. This is unacceptable.

Remove Huda Beauty products now.
Thank you,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Sephora,
Huda Kattan just told 5 million followers she doesn't understand Iran's situation, then spread regime propaganda calling a massacre an "internal issue."
Reality: 36,000+ dead. 24,000 facing execution. Total communications blackout preventing Iranian Americans from knowing if their families are alive. This isn't internal politics - it's genocide.
Huda is providing cover for mass murder while admitting ignorance. Every dollar spent on her products funds someone whitewashing atrocities.

Remove Huda Beauty immediately.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Sephora Beauty,
On January 28th, Huda Kattan admitted knowing nothing about Iran, then shared Islamic Republic propaganda to millions, dismissing 36,000+ deaths as an "internal matter."
Iranian Americans are terrified with no contact with families for two weeks. The regime has killed over 36,000 people and plans to execute 24,000 more. Huda's propaganda helps the regime hide these crimes from the world.
Sephora should not sell products from influencers who spread dangerous misinformation during ongoing massacres.

Please discontinue Huda Beauty products.
Regards,
[Your Name]`,
      `Dear Sephora,
Huda Kattan spread Iranian regime propaganda yesterday despite admitting she doesn't know what's happening. She told 5 million followers the massacre is just an "internal issue."
The truth: 36,000+ killed since December 28. Iranian Americans unable to reach families for weeks due to total blackout. 24,000 protesters sentenced to death. This is one of history's worst massacres happening right now.
By platforming regime propaganda, Huda provides cover for genocide. Sephora must not profit from this.
Remove all Huda Beauty products immediately.
Thank you,
[Your Name]`
